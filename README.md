# Meanwell IRM 20/30 Board

Simple board to quickly use the great Meanwell AC/DC power supply modules either in parallel or serien for a simple bipolar power supply.

You can connect your project to the JST EH connectors or solder wires directly to the board. The footprint for the IRM Board is a combination of 
20W and 30W modules, so you can use both. For example, you could use two 48V PSUs for a 96V power supply to power low voltage tube amps, or use 
two IRM-20-15 in series with GND connected to the "Voltage Conenct" header to get a great, simple and cheap biplar power supply for headphone 
amps and such.
